1. JS having .js engines differently in different browsers
2. too much code for simple business operations
3. no bulild in functions support for utility operations
4. Can not directly communcate with web servers/ db servers
5. depends upon tools like Ajax for async calls
6. DOM  manupulations fifferent from browser to browser.

    -> Follows MVC based programing arch
    -> Standards from the framework specs
    -> maintenace and extension of applications are easy
